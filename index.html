					It all started when a twenty-six year old woman named Mimi Vallée brought three individual entrepreneurs together. As close friends to Mimi in a gluten-intolerant advice and support group, these three were the first to witness her despair when she realized that as a single mother of two, not only was there no way she was able to spend the time to make gluten-free food like her three friends could, but also that there were no gluten-free restaurants near her. </p>
					<p>As it happened to be, these three friends made contact with each other almost immediately. Having already been gluten-intolerant themselves, they were already wavering whether to do something about it. Mimi was the final push: with this event in their lives shaping their experiences, Alina Ying, Pratibha Sriram, and Ria Pradeep came together to start a gluten-free restaurant and bakery on July 1st, 2014.</p>
                    <p>Création was the name.</p>
					<p>Creation is the act of making or producing something that did not exist before; the act of creating something. We saw the need, and we came to fulfill it. As a nod to our dear friend Mimi Vallée, we decided to make our restaurant centered around French cuisine.</p>

					On February 19th, 2015, we drew up a business plan with a clear definition of our concept, a description of our market, menu and pricing, as well as detailed financial information, including data on our startup capital and long-term income and expense forecasts.  </p>
					<p>On July 24th, 2015, the location of 3481 Melrose Place in Santana Row, California was finally officially settled. Our vision for the restaurant and bakery kept on growing bigger and bigger. </p> 

					<p>On December 2nd, 2015, we hired Head Chef Louis Jean-Benoït, Assistant Chef Pierre de la Rue, and patisserie Rose Anne-Thérèse, three clear leaders in their respective niches. We also found 7 dedicated waiters. Our journey was about to begin.</p>

                    <p>Having only started this year, Création is also immensely honored to have already received the Bib Gourmand Award recently. Not only does the award prove that Création has good food, it also shows that Création is affordable. To our restaurant’s goal and vision, there can be no higher compliment. We strive to provide the opportunity of good eating to gluten-intolerant customers, and help treat celiac disease as a whole. </p>
                    
                    <p>Création is looking forward to further achievements, and will not stop until it has reached the pinnacle of gluten-free cuisine. As the proud owners of this restaurant and bakery, Alina Ying, Pratibha Sriram, and Ria Pradeep extend their thanks to all their customers and supporters. Thank you for helping us come so far, and we are looking forward to your future assistance.
